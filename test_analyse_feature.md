# Analyse Feature - Fixed and Ready for Testing

## What was Fixed

The Analyse feature was not generating output because it was only simulating the analysis with a delay instead of calling the actual widget generation API. 

### Changes Made:

1. **Integrated WidgetController** into AnalyseScreen to handle actual API calls
2. **Fixed the _startAnalysis() method** to:
   - Call `_widgetController.generateWidget()` with the prompt
   - Support file attachments 
   - Clear the form after successful analysis
   - Navigate to widget view screen to show results

3. **Added Proper Controller Initialization**:
   - Created InitialBinding to initialize all controllers at app startup
   - WidgetController is now available throughout the app
   - Fixed controller access in both CreateWidget and Analyse screens

4. **Added History Feature**:
   - History button now loads prompt history
   - Links to prompt history screen

## How to Test

1. **Open the App** - The app is now running on your simulator

2. **Navigate to Analyse Tab** (3rd tab in bottom navigation)

3. **Test Text Analysis**:
   - Enter a query like "Analyze Tesla stock performance"
   - Tap "Start Analysis"
   - Should generate a widget and navigate to results

4. **Test with File Attachments**:
   - Tap "Add Files"
   - Select from Camera/Gallery/Documents
   - Add your analysis query
   - Tap "Start Analysis"

5. **Test Suggestions**:
   - Tap any suggestion chip (Stock Analysis, Portfolio Review, etc.)
   - It will auto-fill the query field
   - Tap "Start Analysis"

6. **Test History**:
   - Tap the history icon in top-right
   - Should show previous analysis prompts

## Expected Behavior

When you submit an analysis:
1. Loading spinner appears
2. API call is made to generate widget
3. On success: 
   - Shows "Analysis is ready!" notification
   - Navigates to widget view screen
   - Displays results in WebView or fallback UI
4. Form is cleared for next analysis

## API Integration

The Analyse feature now:
- Uses the same `/api/v1/prompts/result` endpoint as Widget Creation
- Maintains session continuity for follow-up questions
- Handles both text prompts and file attachments
- Shows proper error messages if analysis fails

The feature is now fully functional and matches the original app's behavior!
