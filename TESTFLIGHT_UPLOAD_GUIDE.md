## üîß Troubleshooting

   ```bash
   # Clean and rebuild
   flutter clean
   cd ios && pod install
   flutter build ios --release
   
   # Recreate archive
   xcodebuild -workspace ios/Runner.xcworkspace \
     -scheme Runner \
     -sdk iphoneos \
     -configuration Release \
     archive \
     -archivePath build/AssetWorks.xcarchive \
     -allowProvisioningUpdates
   ```

3. **Export Options Issues**:
   - Verify `ExportOptions.plist` has correct team ID: "97U2KB248P"
   - Ensure bundle ID matches: "ai.assetworks.mobile"
